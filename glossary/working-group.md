# Working Group

A group of stakeholders with the mission to define [solutions](/glossary/solution.md) to [challenges](/glossary/challenge.md).

The working groups are formed in the [Working Groups phase of the SCORE process](/process/2-working-groups.md).

Once a challenge working group has defined solutions it might be split up into multiple solution working groups.
