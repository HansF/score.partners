# Setting up Developer team Collaboration

Based on the solution definition, partners free up development resources to staff the development teams with product owners and developers (D4.5). Teams from different co-developing partners work to solve a single problem and work on a single codebase. These:

1. Team planning: Set up team planning, decide sprint length, usually 1 or 2 weeks.
2. Development environment: Set up project development environment and collaboration tools.
3. Metrics: Integrate the metrics monitoring system that measures implementation results (D5.2).
4. Organise backlog together with the product owners make sure it is actionable. This happens with input from the problem owners (D2.9).
5. Review: Bradford will coordinate how regular peer-to-peer code reviews will take place (D4.4)

This phase is followed by [Iterative development sprint (Months 6 to 9)](5-development-sprints.md).

## IoT Registry Project example story:

> Amsterdam and Aarhus both provide a team of 1 product owner and 2 front-end developers and 1 back end developer for the entire project. The product owner and a developer set up the project infrastructure (GitHub, Licence and Contributing guidelines, Issue and PR templates), build systems (a Jenkins server) and set up a shared tools for Continuous Integration testing (Coveralls, Greenkeeper)
