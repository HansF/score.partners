# Development Preparations

Based on the [solution definition](3-solution-definition.md), solution [working groups](/glossary/working-group.md) prepare developement and free up development resources to staff the development teams with the product owners and developers (D4.5).

* __Team planning__: Set up team planning, decide on a shared sprint length.
* __Development environment__: Set up project development environment and collaboration tools.
* __Metrics__: Integrate the metrics monitoring system that measures implementation results (D5.2).
* __Prioritise backlog__ with the product owners make sure it is actionable. This happens with input from the problem owners (D2.9).
* __Review__: Bradford will coordinate how regular peer-to-peer code reviews take place (D4.4)

This phase is followed by [Iterative development sprint (Months 6 to 9)](5-development-sprints.md).

## IoT Registry Project example story:

> Amsterdam and Aarhus both provide a team of 1 product owner and 2 front-end developers and 1 back end developer for the entire project. The product owner and a developer set up the project infrastructure (GitHub, Licence and Contributing guidelines, Issue and PR templates), build systems (a Jenkins server) and set up a shared tools for Continuous Integration testing (Coveralls, Greenkeeper)
