# Reuse and upscaling

In order to support as much reuse of the code as possible the developing partners have to make an agreement as to how to provide ongoing project governance, including:

* __Support plan__: Deciding on a plan to continue support and reuse of the project.
* __Replication workshop__: Presenting the solution in a workshop (D4.7) to encourage replication of the solution (D5.3 and D5.6) in other cities not involved in development process.
* __Business cases__: Working with the Aarhus University team to find further business cases and opportunities for uptake and social impact of the projects (D6.1).
* __Training workshops__: co-organised with Dordrecht to train technical and non-technical staff in the use and maintenance of the project (D6.2).
* __Presentations__: co-organised with the Aarhus University around the project (D6.3).

## IoT Registry Project example story:

> The cities of Amsterdam and Aarhus agree that as long as they are using the code ‘in production’ they will provide resources to manage incoming questions, requests and suggested (minor) changes. This to ensure that a lively community of other partner developers can take root and continue to grow.
>
> Over the next 12 months both Dordrecht and the University of Aarhus organise events and workshops that help the project get traction, get adopted by 6 other cities and build a developer community around it. Now that the project is adopted by the 2 developing cities, the 2 living lab implementation cities and 6 more cities the burden for maintaining the project in the future is shared by 10 partners, meaning the quality of public service delivery rises quickly.
