# WP 3/4 - Solution Definition (Months 3 to 5)

Once approved, product owners and developers from each co-developing partner defined what to develop. The project definition serves as an Agile replacement of the specifications of software (D3.7).

1. Metrics: Define metrics of success, including metrics to measure increased development efficacy (D4.10), quality and cost of public service delivery (D5.2) to report on SCORE indicators.
2. Architectural principles: Define basic architecture and architectural principles.
3. Codebase: Decide on a fitting project and codebase governance model for this specific project.
4. Research: Research existing Open Source libraries that can be used, built on or give inspiration.
5. Backlog: Create a ‘backlog’ of all of the problems that need to be solved and requirements with the problem owners.
6. Communication: Work with D2.6 team to define a marketing and social media plan to connect with the wider ecosystem and bring in other interested partners/developers in the development.

This phase is followed by [Setting up Developer team Collaboration (Months 5 to 6)](development-setup.md).

## IoT Registry Project example story of project definition:

The teams from Amsterdam and Aarhus, both with developers and project owners on them, work together to draft a mission statement for the project, collect user stories from real future users and catalogue the requirements, including a plan of how to effectively test the Docker containers in their actual clouds.  The teams decide to host  both code and discussions on GitHub. Because the cities want others to contribute to the project as much as possible a project governance and contributor model is drafted. This outlines how future collaborators can join, and that the code will be published under a a EUPL licence.
