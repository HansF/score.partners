Every category and every topic has a Notifications button in the top right corner, it has a little round icon on it that is either grey or blue, depending on your notification settings. Click this button to open the menu that allows you to set a specific notification level for that category or topic.

Clicking the button will open a menu with your options.

## Notification options

The notification menu provides options ranging from 'Watching', for which you will be notified of everything that happens, to 'Muted' which means you will not receive any notifications, even if someone mentions you by name specifically.

We suggest going through the categories and setting the Notification options to what is relevant to you and what you are involved in.
