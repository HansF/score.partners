# Vision

> The goal of this document is to set out the vision SCORE so that it is understandable for those inside and outside of the project. This document should answer the question whether something is within the scope of SCORE or not.

SCORE is a partnership of governments, universities and other organisations that collaboratively discover, develop and test Open [solutions](glossary/solution.md) for the challenges of cities.
The SCORE [partners](glossary/partner.md) leverage [Open Collaboration](glossary/open-collaboration.md) methodologies – Open Source, Open Data, Open Standards and an open attitude – to learn together, communicate effectively, share challenges and collaborate on solutions with the goal of improving public service delivery in our cities.

By working Open we create a partnership of cities that are used to sharing and identifying common [challenges](glossary/challenge.md) as well as re-using each others solutions, improving them collaboratively and sharing their own. We learn how to solve our own challenges whilst both learning from and teaching to the others. We solve the challenges of our cities together.

We build [Open Source](glossary/open-source.md) solutions that are made to be re-used by others. These solutions are build using [Open Standards](glossary/open-standard.md) and with [Open Data](glossary/open-data.md) in mind. Together we’ve developed and maintain [guidelines for the quality of code](https://github.com/score-partners/quality-code) that guarantee others can use and re-use our solutions.
